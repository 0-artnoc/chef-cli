# What is this script?
#
# Chef-DK uses a workflow tool called Expeditor to manage version bumps, changelogs
# and releases. This script updates the version of the Chef gem when a new release
# of Chef is promoted to stable. This repo subscribes to the artifact promotion and
# updates Gemfile then runs bundle update to pull in the new gem.
