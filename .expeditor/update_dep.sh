# What is this script?
#
# Chef-DK uses a workflow tool called Expeditor to manage version bumps, changelogs
# and releases. When a dependency of chef is released, expeditor is triggered
# against this repository to run this script. It bumps our gem lock files and opens
# a PR. That way humans can do hard work and bots can open gem bump PRs.
