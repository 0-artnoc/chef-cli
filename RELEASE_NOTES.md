# ChefDK 2.4 Release Notes

## Improved Performance Downloading Cookbooks from a Chef Server

Policyfile users who use a Chef Server as a cookbook source will
experience faster cookbook downloads when running `chef install`. Chef
Server's API requires each file in a cookbook to be downloaded
separately; ChefDK will now download the files in parallel.
Additionally, HTTP keepalives are enabled to reduce connection overhead.

## Cookbook Artifact Source for Policyfiles

Policyfile users may now source cookbooks from the Chef Server's
cookbook artifact store. This is mainly intended to support the upcoming
`include_policy` feature, but could be useful in some situations.

Given a cookbook that has been uploaded to the Chef Server via `chef push`,
it can be used in another policy by adding code like the following to
the ruby policyfile:

```
cookbook "runit",
  chef_server_artifact: "https://chef.example/organizations/myorg",
  identifier: "09d43fad354b3efcc5b5836fef5137131f60f974"
```

## Add include_policy directive
Policyfile maybe now use the `include_policy` directive as described in
[RFC097](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc097-policyfile-includes.md).
This directive's purpose is to allow the inclusion policyfile locks to the current
policyfile. In this iteration, we support sourcing lock files from a local path or a
chef server. Below is a simple example of how the `include_policy` directive can be used.

Given a policyfile `base.rb`:
```
name 'base'

default_source :supermarket

run_list 'motd'

cookbook 'motd', '~> 0.6.0'
```

Run:
```
>> chef install ./base.rb

Building policy base
Expanded run list: recipe[motd]
Caching Cookbooks...
Using      motd         0.6.4
Using      chef_handler 3.0.2

Lockfile written to /home/jaym/workspace/chef-dk/base.lock.json
Policy revision id: 1238e7a353ec07a4df6636cdffd8805220a00789bace96d6d70268a4b0064023
```

This will produce the `base.lock.json` that will be included in our next policy `users.rb`:
```
name 'users'

default_source :supermarket

run_list 'user'

cookbook 'user', '~> 0.7.0'

include_policy 'base', path: './base.lock.json'
```

Run:
```
>> chef install ./users.rb

Building policy users
Expanded run list: recipe[motd::default], recipe[user]
Caching Cookbooks...
Using      motd         0.6.4
Installing user         0.7.0
Using      chef_handler 3.0.2

Lockfile written to /home/jaym/workspace/chef-dk/users.lock.json
Policy revision id: 20fac68f987152f62a2761e1cfc7f1dc29b598303bfb2d84a115557e2a4a8f27
```

This will produce a `users.lock.json` that has the `base` policyfile lock merged in.

[RFC097](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc097-policyfile-includes.md) and
